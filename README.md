# OpenCV-YOLO
This project is an Open-CV project Done with YOLO Detection Algorithm.


What is YOLO Object Detection?
YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is incredibly fast and accurate. We send an input image to a CNN which outputs a 19 X 19 X 5 X 85 dimension volume. Here, the grid size is 19 X 19 and each grid contains 5 boxes.
